#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of high-quality software applications.
- Software engineering is crucial in the technology industry as it ensures the development of high-quality, scalable, and efficient software products. By implementing structured testing and validation processes, it minimizes bugs and     
  enhances performance, leading to higher user satisfaction. Additionally Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of 
  modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
- Through methodologies like Waterfall, Agile and Scrum, software engineering maximizes productivity, reduces costs by preventing errors, and enables seamless maintenance and upgrades. Additionally, it fosters adaptability to evolving 
  technologies, embeds security from the ground up, and promotes collaboration through practices like version control and code reviews, which are essential for complex projects.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestones include:
1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) - The creation of early programming languages was a critical milestone in software engineering, providing the tools needed to write and execute programs. The development of Fortran (1957) by IBM was groundbreaking as it was one of the first high-level programming languages, designed specifically for scientific and engineering calculations.
C (1972), developed at Bell Labs, became another pivotal language due to its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. C's influence is profound, as it led to the creation of many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python, and it remains widely used for system programming and developing operating systems.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - Software engineering was formally recognized as a distinct engineering discipline at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the growing "software crisis," where the complexity of software systems was outpacing the ability of developers to manage and deliver them reliably. The term "software engineering" was coined to emphasize the need for a more structured, methodical approach to software development, akin to traditional engineering disciplines. This milestone marked the beginning of efforts to apply engineering principles, such as rigorous testing, documentation, and project management, to the creation of software, setting the foundation for the modern practices that ensure software quality, reliability, and maintainability.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s - structured programming emerged as a solution to the chaotic and error-prone nature of early programming practices. 
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s - In the early 2000s, the software development industry began shifting towards Agile methodologies, which represented a significant departure from the traditional Waterfall model. The Waterfall approach was linear and rigid, requiring each phase of development to be completed before moving on to the next. In contrast, Agile promotes iterative development, where software is developed in small, manageable increments, with continuous feedback from customers and stakeholders. This allows teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver functional software more frequently. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) involves several key phases, including:

1. Requirements Gathering: Collecting and documenting the needs and expectations of users and defining the system's requirements.
2. Design: Developing both high-level and detailed plans for the software’s architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Coding and building the software based on the design specifications.
4. Testing: Performing various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functions as intended.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software for use by customers or end-users.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and improvements to the software after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear approach where each phase of software development is completed sequentially before moving to the next, flowing downwards like a waterfall. It’s rigid and relies heavily on upfront planning    and documentation.
  example scenario:  Ideal for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as developing a regulatory compliance system thus Best for projects with clear, unchanging requirements.

- Agile methodology is an iterative, flexible approach that focuses on continuous development, testing, and customer feedback. It allows for adapting to changing requirements throughout the project.
  example scenario: Suitable for projects where requirements may evolve, like developing a startup's mobile app or an e-commerce site that needs frequent updates.

In comparison between the two methodologies:
- Waterfall is linear and sequential; Agile is iterative and flexible.
- Waterfall is rigid and less adaptable to changes, while Agile allows for ongoing adjustments.
- Waterfall emphasizes detailed documentation; Agile prioritizes working software with lighter documentation.
- Waterfall gathers feedback after development; Agile incorporates feedback continuously.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software platforms that offer a range of tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Tools used to manage source code changes and facilitate collaboration among developers (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing Requirements: Adjustments in project requirements during the development cycle can lead to scope creep and delays.
   Strategy: Implement agile methodologies to accommodate changes more flexibly, maintain effective communication with stakeholders, and use iterative development to manage evolving requirements.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to meet deadlines can result in rushed work, impacting the quality of the final product.
   Strategy: Prioritize tasks, set realistic milestones, and use time management techniques to balance quality and schedule. Regularly review progress to adjust timelines and resources as needed.
3. Technical Debt: Shortcuts or less optimal solutions can accumulate technical debt, complicating future development and increasing maintenance costs.
   Strategy: Address technical debt proactively by refactoring code regularly, investing in code quality practices, and integrating technical debt management into the development process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing:Tests individual components or modules in isolation.
Importance: Identifies and fixes bugs early, ensuring each part works correctly before integration.

2. Integration Testing: Tests interactions between different components or subsystems.
Importance: Detects issues arising from combined components and ensures they work together properly.

3. System Testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole.
Importance: Validates that the complete system meets all requirements and functions as intended.

4. Acceptance Testing: Tests the software against user requirements.
Importance: Ensures the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering refers to the practice of crafting precise and well-defined questions or statements to obtain the most accurate and relevant responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering is crucial because it helps avoid vague or confusing answers that can arise from poorly constructed queries. By making questions clear and specific, it ensures that the AI understands exactly what is being asked, leading to more useful and relevant responses. This precision in communication enhances the effectiveness of interactions with AI, making it a valuable skill for maximizing the value derived from AI technologies.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."

- Improved Prompt: "Can you provide a summary of key events in Kenya's history from independence to the present day?"

The Improved Prompt is More Effective beause: it is clear, specific and concise. 
- It specifies the focus on Kenya’s history, which narrows down the topic from the general concept of "history."
- It asks for a summary of key events from independence to the present day, guiding the AI to cover significant milestones within a defined timeframe.
- It is direct and focused, avoiding broad or ambiguous requests.
